# Project history / Submarine Game
 This project was only developed by me, and was originally titled "Submarine Game" within the unity project manager.
 So, if at all you see "Submarine Game" within the source code please keep in 
 mind that that was the project's name.

# What is this project?
 Around a year ago I decided to begin learning how networking is done in game engines, and how networking actually works under the hood.
 I learned a lot about stuff like Serialization, Packets, RPCs, ect.
